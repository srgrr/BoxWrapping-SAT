You already have the latest binaries that correspond to the source code in the folder.

If they do not work:
  Type make main to compile the main program.
  Type g++ -o checker checker.cc -O2 -std=c++17

Type python run_all.py to run the solver on all the instances.

You need lingeling installed and visible to be able to run my implementation.

You need the instances folder to be on the src folder to make this work.
